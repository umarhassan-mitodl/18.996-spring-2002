Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session

Lecturers
---------

Tom Leighton, Bruce Maggs (CMU/Akamai), Ravi Sundaram (Akamai), and Shang-Hua Teng (BU/Akamai)

Prerequisites
-------------

Introduction to Algorithms: [6.046](/courses/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005) or [18.410](/courses/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005)

The Course
----------

We will discuss numerous research problems that are related to the internet. Sample topics include: routing algorithms such as BGP, communication protocols such as TCP, algorithms for intelligently selecting a resource in the face of uncertainty, bandwidth sensing tools, load balancing algorithms, streaming protocols, determining the structure of the internet, cost optimization, DNS-related problems, visualization, and large-scale data processing. The seminar is intended for students who are ready to work on challenging research problems. Each lecture will discuss

*   methods used today
*   issues and problems
*   formulation of concrete problems
*   potential new lines of research

A modest amount of background information will be provided so that the importance and context of the problems can be understood. No previous study of the internet is required, but experience with algorithms and/or theoretical computer science at the graduate/research level is needed.

Requirements
------------

The class will not have any exams. Students will be asked to scribe lecture notes. Each lecture will have an assigned "scribe", whose job is to take notes for later distribution to the class. The notes should not be a simple copy of what is written on the white/blackboard. They have to be written to show that the scribe understands the material.

Please use the following LaTeX package to prepare the notes

*   LaTex Style Package ({{% resource_link "e1ec6614-4857-9b75-5997-097a28177ab5" "STY" %}})
*   Sample (LaTeX) ({{% resource_link "36a7f2de-fd5c-c0fe-d24c-8a2716260c71" "TEX" %}})
